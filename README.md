## Facts about drug overdose death

#### 1. Using drug alone
The B.C. Coroners Service says more than 1,400 people died of an illicit drug overdose in the province in 2017, nearly 90% of them were alone inside a home when they suffered an overdose. 

If the victim called 911 via cellular devices and wasn’t able to provide address, latitude and longitude location-tracking is accurate within 50-300 meters, which means up to a 984-foot permissible radius, which entails a difficult search in high-density areas, like apartment buildings, public spaces.

#### 2. 911 response time 
Canadians make 12 million calls to 911 every year. The national response time goal for paramedics in Canada is 8 minutes 59 seconds, for the most serious emergencies. 

#### 3. Reluctance to call 911
Based on the data collected from CCENDU members between 2013 and 2016, between 30% and 65% of those who witnessed an apparent overdose situation did not call 911. 

Among those who reported not calling 911, 47% thought the situation was controlled, 38% reported fear of the police, 10% said they had no phone. 

## Project Agenda

1. Help unattended patients send locations
2. Decrease witnesses reluctance to seeking medical help 
3. Shorten the untreated waiting period of the patient


## Project target users
1. Drug overdosed patients who are impaired to call 911, give their address and alert their contacts 
   Application: one-click solution for sending out help request with their pre-registered information and geolocation to paramedics and nearby volunteers, alert their contacts

2. Witnesses who are not willing to get involved except reporting 
  Application: One-click solution for sending out report message with the geolocation to nearby volunteers 

3. Witnesses who are family or friends that seeking further help in addition to 911 emergency call
   Application: 
sending out a report message with geolocation, exact address, patients symptoms to nearby volunteers
providing further guidance on how to aid the patient before help arrives
providing in-app chat channel with the volunteers 

4. certified/ trained volunteers who are willing to help drug overdose patients nearby
   Application: volunteers will receive a message with the patients’ geolocation ( and further details if provided) 


## Project reasoning behind 

1. The probability of surviving a drug overdose depends, in part, on the speed with which the person receives appropriate care or emergency intervention. 
By reaching out to the trained volunteers nearby who can arrive and provide immediate help before paramedics arrive, we believe it can cut the patients untreated waiting period by more than half, and significantly decrease the number of fatalities or brain injuries 

2. Most of the witness is reluctant to call 911 due to the underestimation of the situation severance. By reporting to trained volunteers nearby instead of 911, the app can increase the likelihood of the victims getting professional care. 

3. 10% of the death occurs to homeless people, who might not have a phone to call emergency and relies solely on the help of the witnesses passing by. 
On top of that, one of the main reasons for bystanders (drug dealer for instance) not calling 911 was concern about police involvement and possible arrest.
By providing one-click, no-hassle, volunteers directed reports option instead of 911, the project can increase the possibility of patients getting medical attention.
